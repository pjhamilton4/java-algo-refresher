# Linked Lists
A data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. Unlike arrays, linked lists do no provide constant time access to a particular "index".

## Types
- ### Singly Linked List
    Each node points to the next node in the linked list.
- ### Doubly Linked List
    Each node has pointers to both the next and the previous node.
- ### Circular Linked List
    The last node contains a reference to the first node as next, and the first node has a reference to the last node as previous.

## Basic Operations
- ### Insertion
- ### Deletion
- ### Display
